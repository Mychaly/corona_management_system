# Coronavirus Management System for  Health Fund

This project is aimed at developing a FullStack system for managing a coronavirus database for a large health fund. The system will provide functionality to display members of the health fund, allowing for their editing and deletion, and will manage the records in the database. Additionally, the system will aggregate key information regarding the coronavirus pandemic in relation to the members of the health fund. This database will be accessible in the future for various retrieval purposes.
